# 🧩 Wireframing

## ✨ Introduction

**Wireframing** is a fundamental step in the design process that involves creating low-fidelity visual representations of a website or application's layout. These sketches, diagrams, or mockups are used to plan the structure and flow of a digital interface before actual development begins.

Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders understand the content placement, navigation, and functionality of a product—without being distracted by colors, styles, or graphics.

## 🎯 Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing is essential for several reasons:

- ✅ **Clarifies Vision**  
  It helps transform ideas into a structured visual format, allowing for early feedback and clearer communication.

- 🔄 **Saves Time & Cost**  
  Identifying design flaws at the wireframe stage is easier and cheaper than doing so in development.

- 🧠 **Focuses on User Experience (UX)**  
  It emphasizes layout, flow, and usability, ensuring the user journey is intuitive.

- 🤝 **Improves Collaboration**  
  Wireframes serve as a shared blueprint that unites designers, developers, and stakeholders around the same understanding.

## 🧾 Types of Wireframes

Wireframes come in different levels of detail, depending on the stage of the design process. The two main types are **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity** wireframes.

---

### 🔹 Low-Fidelity Wireframes

These are basic, grayscale sketches or outlines used during the early stages of design.

**Characteristics**:
- Simple boxes and lines
- Focus on layout, structure, and content hierarchy
- No images, colors, or branding
- Often hand-drawn or created with basic tools

**When it's used**:
- During brainstorming or ideation
- For quick feedback from team members or stakeholders

---

### 🔹 High-Fidelity Wireframes

These are detailed, polished wireframes that closely resemble the final product.

**Characteristics**:
- Includes images, colors, fonts, and branding elements
- Interactive elements and real content are often shown
- Shows precise spacing, alignment, and UI components

**When it's used**:
- After initial concepts are approved
- For stakeholder presentations, prototyping, or developer handoff

## 🖼️ Wireframe Type: Project Example

![Mobile App Wireframes](26.06.2025_22.24.28_REC.png)

The wireframe image shown above is an example of a **high-fidelity wireframe**.

**Why?**  
- It displays full-color mobile screens with specific content, icons, and user interface components.
- Screens include visual details for **Splash**, **Sign In**, **Login**, **Join**, **Home**, **Details**, and **Reservation** pages.
- It reflects a near-complete user flow and can be used for prototyping or development.

**Conclusion**:  
This type of wireframe is ideal for testing user experience, demonstrating visual direction to stakeholders, and handing off to developers for implementation.
