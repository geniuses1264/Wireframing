# 🧩 Wireframing

## ✨ Introduction

**Wireframing** is a fundamental step in the design process that involves creating low-fidelity visual representations of a website or application's layout. These sketches, diagrams, or mockups are used to plan the structure and flow of a digital interface before actual development begins.

Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders understand the content placement, navigation, and functionality of a product—without being distracted by colors, styles, or graphics.

## 🎯 Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing is essential for several reasons:

- ✅ **Clarifies Vision**  
  It helps transform ideas into a structured visual format, allowing for early feedback and clearer communication.

- 🔄 **Saves Time & Cost**  
  Identifying design flaws at the wireframe stage is easier and cheaper than doing so in development.

- 🧠 **Focuses on User Experience (UX)**  
  It emphasizes layout, flow, and usability, ensuring the user journey is intuitive.

- 🤝 **Improves Collaboration**  
  Wireframes serve as a shared blueprint that unites designers, developers, and stakeholders around the same understanding.
